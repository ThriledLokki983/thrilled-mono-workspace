## ❌ FAILING TESTS (7 projects)

### 🔸 uploads:test - SHARP/LIBVIPS ISSUE
**Problem:** Sharp module can't load `libvips-cpp.42.dylib` on darwin-arm64
```
ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED: Library not loaded: @rpath/libvips-cpp.42.dylib
```
**Impact:** Image processing functionality broken
**Fix needed:** Reinstall sharp with proper platform dependencies

### 🔸 base-be:test - ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION
**Problem:** Missing required environment variables during test execution
```
process.exit called with "1" - validateEnv() failure
```
**Impact:** Application config validation failing
**Fix needed:** Set up proper test environment variables (.env.test)

### 🔸 monitoring:test - HEALTH CHECK LOGIC
**Problem:** Health check status expectations mismatch
- Expected: "healthy" → Received: "degraded"
- Expected: "degraded" → Received: "unhealthy"
**Impact:** Health monitoring tests failing
**Fix needed:** Review health check thresholds and logic

### 🔸 faithcircle-fe:test - MODULE RESOLUTION
**Problem:** Cannot resolve `@mono/components` import in frontend
```
Failed to resolve import "@mono/components" from "apps/fe/faithcircle-fe/src/app/app.tsx"
```
**Impact:** Frontend component tests failing
**Fix needed:** Fix workspace module resolution for frontend

### 🔸 @thrilled/faithcircle-be:test - JEST PRESET
**Problem:** Jest preset not found
```
Preset ../../../jest.preset.js not found
```
**Impact:** Backend test configuration broken
**Fix needed:** Fix jest configuration paths

### 🔸 validation:test - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
**Status:** Unknown failure - requires detailed analysis

### 🔸 core:test - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
**Status:** Unknown failure - requires detailed analysis

## 🎯 PRIORITY FIXES (In Order)

1. **Environment Setup** - Create proper test environment variables
2. **Sharp/Libvips** - Fix ARM64 macOS native dependency issues
3. **Module Resolution** - Fix frontend workspace imports
4. **Jest Configuration** - Fix preset paths and configuration
5. **Health Check Logic** - Review and adjust health check expectations

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions
1. Create `.env.test` file with required environment variables
2. Run `yarn add sharp --force` to reinstall with proper ARM64 binaries
3. Fix `@mono/components` module resolution in frontend
4. Update Jest preset paths in faithcircle-be configuration

### Medium Priority
1. Investigate `validation:test` and `core:test` failures in detail
2. Review health check service logic and test expectations
3. Ensure all workspace dependencies are properly linked

## 📈 PROGRESS TRACKING

**TypeScript Status:** 27/28 projects passing typecheck (96.4% success)
**Test Status:** 8/15 projects passing tests (53.3% success)
**Build Status:** Most projects building successfully

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Focus on Infrastructure Issues First:** Environment setup and native dependencies are blocking multiple tests
2. **Improve Test Environment:** Set up proper test configuration and environment isolation
3. **Module Resolution:** Ensure workspace module resolution works consistently across all project types
4. **Health Check Review:** The monitoring service may have overly strict health check criteria
